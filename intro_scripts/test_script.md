# How to run the test script
### Computing epsilon with the new method

To create a data frame with the median epsilon of each snapshot and the corresponding redshift, run from the terminal:  

    python3 test_script.py x y  

where x is the halo number and y is the simulation level. This will print the head of the data frame. 

For example, if you want to run halo 6 at level 3, run from the `arepo-snap-util` directory:

    python3 test_script.py 6 3
